# Design Patterns (Can make code more maintainable and testable)

- There are two categories in programming.
  1) Architecture Pattern (Decides the folder structure and responsibilities of files inside those folders)
     - MVC, MVVM, MVP, VIPER, Publisher/Subcriber
  3) Design Pattern (In code, we use a specific coding structure to solve a specific problem)
     - Creational, Structural, Behavior, Concurrency

## Creational Patterns
### Why to use Creational Patterns ?
- Using Creational Pattern we are separating object creation responsibility from it's consumer.
- Single Responsibilty Principle
- Inversion of Control [IOC- Design principle]
- Code to create object is not coupled with view controller or view model
- Implementing Abstraction
- Loosely coupled code

- There is a trade off that it violates open close principle.

## Factory
- Very Simple and easy design pattern. You cannot use factory pattern at all place.

## Builder
-

## Singleton
- 

## Abstract Factory
-

## Prototype

## Object Pool
